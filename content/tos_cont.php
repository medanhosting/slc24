<h2><span>Terms of Service</span></h2>
<h3>Shut down</h3>
We are not a bank. We can shut down this service at any time. However, this will be announced four weeks in advance so that you can withdraw anything you have on your account.<br />

<h3>Exclusion from service</h3>
We can exclude you from this service or parts of it (e.g. trading) at any time (e.g. if we feel you've abused the service). This does not include withdrawing, of course (except if you tried to hack the site).<br />

<h3>Interruptions</h3>
We can interrupt the service at any time for maintainance or other exceptional reasons. We will announce the interruption as soon as we can if the interruption is foreseeable.<br />

<h3>Liability</h3>
We take all precautions we can and try to make this service as safe as we can (this is in our own interest). However, we are not liable for any loss of your Solidcoins, Bitcoins or Namecoins you stored at Solidcoin24. This refers to a possible loss of private keys holding your coins or transferring coins to another person's wallet (e.g. hacker attack, severe bug).
